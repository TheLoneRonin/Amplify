## Amplify Presentation Copy

### Slide 1

Amplify is the distributed economy for Arweave Gateways. The core intention of Amplify is to bridge the gap for incentivizing Gateways to serve content on the permaweb.

### Slide 2

The key thing to factor with Arweave is that currently, it incentivizes you to store data and share bandwidth with other nodes. However, Arweave does not incentivize you to serve that same data for end users such as web applications.

### Slide 3

This is where Amplify comes into play by paying you to operate trusted Arweave Gateways. By running a Gateway on Amplify, you passively generate income. This income is based off of a proof of stake model where rewards are proportionate to the amount of tokens staked.

### Slide 4

A large part of why Amplify was created is because it acts as a consensus protocol for Arweave Gateways. Amplify constantly tests and validates Gateways through the use of proxies. Furthermore, the good Gateway that identifies the other malicious Gateway is rewarded their tokens if the consensus is that Gateway was outputting malicious data to the network.

### Slide 5

Consensus is achieved by having leader nodes elect malicious Gateways if they are outputting incorrect data. These elected nodes are voted on by other Gateways. Upon majority votes that the Gateway is outputting incorrect data. Said Gateway is removed from the network.

### Slide 6

Amplify identifies malicious Gateways through the use of proxies to query and test bad nodes. It is a requirement that all Gateways use proxies in order to be eligible to vote on malicious activity and to be part of the Amplify Network. These test queries on Gateways are done randomly by all Gateways and are then voted on during each election period.

### Slide 7

The token structure of Amplify is intended to be as straight forward and simple as possible. With a 1 million starting supply. Every year 1 million tokens are minted. This Token Model reflects something very similar to Ethereum's Token Model. Furthermore, these tokens are awarded using the Profit Sharing function built into Smartweave.
